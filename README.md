### Colors Converter

I created this project during the General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course (WDI-18 Sydney). 

Every time the keyspace button is pressed a new, random colour will be generated for  the background. 
In Addition I built a simple calculator to convert HEX to RGB colours and vice versa.


For this project I used:
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
